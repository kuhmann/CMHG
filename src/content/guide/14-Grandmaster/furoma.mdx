## Training Grounds

![Training Grounds](/images/locations/training-grounds.png)
<p class="location-description">A place of study, the students that train along the northern shore of the Burroughs River are indeed a worthy foe. Hunters who prove themselves as formidable opponents may earn the right to challenge the students' teachers.</p>

You will need a Tactical weapon to catch the mice in Training Grounds easily.

Use Mutated Venus Mouse Trap, Dehydration Base and Brie Cheese.

Catch Archer Mouse until you loot **Ticket to the Burroughs Bazaar**.

Claim the adventure **Take an Archery Lesson** at the Training Grounds once you obtain **Ticket to the Burroughs Bazaar**.

## Bazaar

![Bazaar](/images/locations/bazaar.png)
<p class="location-description">The organizers of the Bazaar used to travel abroad with a merchant companion named Ronza. During their visit to the Burroughs region, these quirky folk felt right at home, so much so that they decided to stay! Their newly constructed shops are now known across the Kingdom for their strange inventory.</p>

You aren’t going to hunt in Bazaar. If you must, use a Physical or Tactical set-up with highest luck.

The most useful part of the Bazaar is the Cartographer, which sells and repairs map pieces.

Purchase Stitched Furoma Map Piece from Bazaar Cartographer. It’s quite expensive, so you may have to return to Mousoleum and Laboratory to earn the gold required.

Travel to Dojo once you have purchased the map piece.

## Dojo

![Dojo](/images/locations/dojo.png)
<p class="location-description">The ground floor of the Furoma Pagoda is where students most frequently train. Be cautious of your trap setup when hunting here as students are resistant to basic attacks.</p>

A Tactical weapon is needed to catch the mice in Dojo well.

Use Mutated Venus Mouse Trap, Dehydration Base and Brie Cheese.

- Catch a Student of the Cheese Belt Mouse to loot a Token of the Cheese Belt.
- Catch a Student of the Cheese Claw Mouse to loot a Token of the Cheese Claw.
- Catch a Student of the Cheese Fang Mouse to loot a Token of the Cheese Fang.

Maki Cheese increases the attraction rate of the above mice but is not worth the cost.

<Callout>
A much faster way to obtain the tokens is via the King's Cart. You can buy 1 Cheese Belt Token Pack, 1 Cheese Claw Token Pack and 1 Cheese Fang Token Pack.
</Callout>

Travel to Meditation Room once you have at least 6 of each token.

## Meditation Room

![Meditation Room](/images/locations/meditation-room.png)
<p class="location-description">The second floor of the Pagoda is where the Masters of the three cheese schools meditate and study. These Masters are far too wise to go for conventional bait. Instead, a hunter will need to craft very specific bait in order to attract each master.</p>

A Tactical weapon is needed to catch the mice in Meditation Room easily.

If you don’t have an Ambush Trap Blueprints yet, use Mutated Venus Mouse Trap, Dehydration Base, and Brie Cheese. Use Swiss Cheese if you’re low on gold.

- Catch Hapless Mouse until you loot Ambush Trap Blueprints.
- Craft 2 batches of Glutter Cheese to catch a Master of the Cheese Belt Mouse, giving you a Master Belt Shard.
- Craft 2 batches of Susheese Cheese to catch a Master of the Cheese Claw Mouse, giving you a Master Claw Shard.
- Craft 2 batches of Combat Cheese to catch a Master of the Cheese Fang Mouse, giving you a Master Fang Shard.

Super Power Charms you've looted loot or Power Charms purchased from the Mountain Charm Shoppe is recommended with Glutter Cheese, Susheese Cheese and Combat Cheese.

- Combine 1 Master Belt Shard, 1 Master Claw Shard and 1 Master Fang Shard to obtain 1 Master’s Seal.
- Buy Ambush Trap from the Trapsmith.

<Callout>
Mousoleum and Laboratory are very helpful if you need more gold.

## Pinnacle Chamber

![Pinnacle Chamber](/images/locations/pinnacle-chamber.png)
<p class="location-description">The stairs that lead to the third and final floor of the Pagoda are behind a thick, opulent set of double doors and are extremely well guarded. The grand chamber of this floor is where the Masters of the Dojo reside, occasionally seen peering over the landscape they wish to enslave. Any hunter wishing to challenge these powerful mice will require an unstable and rare cheese.</p>

- Loot 3 Tokens of the Cheese Belt, 3 Tokens of the Cheese Claw and 3 Tokens of the Cheese Fang from respective student mice in Dojo.
- Craft 1 batch of Glutter Cheese, 1 batch of Susheese Cheese and 1 batch of Combat Cheese to catch 1 of each master mouse in Meditation Room.
- Travel to Pinnacle Chamber.
- Craft 1 batch of Rumble Cheese to catch 1 Master of the Dojo Mouse. Master of the Dojo Mouse drops Onyx Stone.

It is recommended to arm charms like Chrome Charm to boost catch rate when using aforementioned crafted cheese.

Claim the adventure **Capture the Master of the Dojo** after you have caught Master of the Dojo Mouse.

## Great Gnarled Tree (Again)

Now that you have Ambush Trap, use it with Dehydration Base, and Brie Cheese to loot Gnarled Potions.

Collect at least 5 Gnarled Potions. It’s not a common drop, but it does show up as the Gift of the Day sometimes, so you may have some already.

Use Gnarled Potions to convert 55 Brie Cheese to Gnarled. The SUPERBrie+ conversion is not worth its cost.

Travel to Lagoon once you get at least 50 Gnarled Cheese.

## Lagoon

![Lagoon](/images/locations/lagoon.png)
<p class="location-description">The enticing blue water hypnotizes hunters, distracting them from the dangerous mice that take up residence nearby. The terrain that surrounds the Lagoon is extremely unsteady, comprised of jagged rocks and slick moss. High up in the trees that surround the Lagoon are the nests of Harpy mice who act as a plague to all hunters, stealing their cheese, gold and crippling their courage. Some mice here are not attracted to conventional bait. It is highly recommended that a hunter use Gnarled cheese when hunting at the Lagoon.</p>

Use Ambush Trap, Dehydration Base, and Gnarled Cheese.

The Lagoon is another aread where you will see more misses than usual. It's worth it, though – you get to build a ship!

Loot 1 Ship Blueprints from Hydra Mouse.

Loot 18 Scrap Metal from

- Steel Mouse from Town of Digby (Recommended)
- Hydra Mouse
- Goblin Mouse

<Callout type="info" title="How to access Town of Digby">

- Craft 3 Limelight Cheese.
- Hunt the Mutated Mole Mice in Laboratory.
- Loot the **Key to the Town of Digby** map piece from the Mutated Mole Mice.
</Callout>

You need at least 650,000 gold to craft the ship. You can get it from Mousoleum and Laboratory.

This is typically the first point that a player finds difficulty in meeting the gold target, so don't despair - you're not alone!

- 1 King’s Reserve Bubbleh
- 70 Bolt of Cloth
- 100 Rope
- 900 Splintered Wood, which can be bought at Training Grounds General Store.

## Calm Clearing

![Calm Clearing](/images/locations/calm-clearing.png)
<p class="location-description">Tucked behind the dense trees of Whisker Woods is a quiet and peaceful clearing. In the center of the clearing is a glowing boulder with colourful fungi growing around it. The magic rock seems to draw mice near to it, as if empowering them.</p>

Use the best trap you have (which can be NVMRC Forcefield Trap or Shrink Ray Trap), Dehydration Base and Brie Cheese.

If you have one or more Cherry Potions in your inventory, you can use it to convert Brie Cheese to Cherry Cheese and then equip that. The SUPERbrie+ conversion is not worth its cost.

Cherry Cheese is required to attract the optional Cherry Mouse.

Catch a Cyclops Mouse that drops Great Gnarled Tree Map Piece.

Claim the adventure **Survey the Calm Clearing**.

Travel to Great Gnarled Tree next.

## Great Gnarled Tree

![Great Gnarled Tree](/images/locations/great-gnarled-tree.png)
<p class="location-description">At the edge of Whisker Woods lies a tree older than Gnawnia itself. Its magic roots stretch far underground and deep into the woods, giving life to the other trees. The shadow it casts is so massive that it began to affect the surrounding area through time, blocking necessary light from other trees. As a result, the other trees seem almost alive as they bend back and forth, seeking out the light.</p>

A Tactical weapon is needed to catch the mice in Great Gnarled Tree easily.

Buy Venus Mouse Trap from Great Gnarled Tree Trapsmith, but donâ€™t equip it yet.

You will need 20 Radioactive Sludge. You get 1 Radioactive Sludge when 1 Radioactive Blue Cheese stales.

If you need more Radioactive Sludge, you have three options.

- Hunt in Laboratory with Brie Cheese to loot Radioactive Sludge from Sludge Scientist Mice. This is slower for getting Radioactive Sludge, but you can also loot Radioactive Blue Potions at the same time.
- Buy 1 Tarnished Charm from Marketplace. Hunt anywhere other than Laboratory and Mousoleum with your stalest set-up, Tarnished Charm, and Radioactive Blue Cheese. You only need 1 Tarnished Charm since it is not consumed upon Fail to Attract. This is noticeably faster.
- You can receive Radioactive Sludge as Gifts from friends. Some hunters prefer receiving Gifts of the Day, which are often of higher value than Radioactive Sludge, so you may need to ask for it specifically.

Once you have at least 20 Radioactive Sludge, craft Mutated Venus Mouse Trap with 1 Venus Mouse Trap Husk and 20 Radioactive Sludge.

Now use Mutated Venus Mouse Trap, Dehydration Base and Brie Cheese to catch Fairy Mouse until you loot Map of the Lagoon.

Claim the adventure **Climb Up the Great Gnarled Tree** once you get Map of the Lagoon.

## Laboratory

![Laboratory](/images/locations/laboratory.png)
<p class="location-description">The original purpose of the Laboratory was to research the minor mouse problem Gnawnia was having. A few less than ethical experiments soon gave rise to new breeds of mice altogether. Now overrun with the very mice it spawned, few hunters dare to step foot on its grounds.</p>

Use the best weapon you have (which can be NVMRC Forcefield Trap or Shrink Ray Trap) and Dehydration Base.

The conventional, sluggish way to begin the area is to use Brie Cheese to loot Radioactive Blue Potions. Radioactive Blue Potions convert Brie Cheese to Radioactive Blue Cheese. Like many other potions, the efficiency increases with rank, so only brew as many as you need. The SUPERbrie+ conversion is **not** worth its cost.

A faster way to obtain Radioactive Blue Cheese is to buy directly from the Marketplace. At Master, it is worth buying Radioactive Blue Cheese rather than farming Radioactive Blue Potions if Radioactive Blue Cheese is lower than 800 gold each.

Use Radioactive Blue Cheese to catch a Monster Mouse. It is not a guaranteed attraction.

Monster Mouse drops Tattered Mousoleum Map Piece, which unlocks Mousoleum. It may also drop Greater Radioactive Blue Potion, which converts Brie Cheese at a better rate than regular ones. If it doesn’t, you can hunt with Brie Cheese to get the first part of the adventure done.

Equipping Scientist’s Charms increases the quantity of Radioactive Blue Potions per hunt, but it’s not worth the price in the Marketplace or the cost to craft them.

Travel to Mousoleum when you have at least 80 Radioactive Blue Cheese.

## Mousoleum

![Mousoleum](/images/locations/mousoleum.png)
<p class="location-description">The scientists of the nearby Laboratory would often come to the Mousoleum to harvest 'spare parts' for their various creations. This grim hunting location is now haunted by spirits of slain mice. The mice of this location seem almost unable to resist radioactive cheese.</p>
You need a Shadow power-type weapon to catch the mice in Mousoleum easily. Buy Bottomless Grave from Laboratory Trapsmith if you have the gold. Otherwise, buy Sinister Portal.

Creepy Coffin Trap is a good premium item and will replace Bottomless Grave and Sinister Portal, but it is not necessary.

Use Bottomless Grave or Sinister Portal, Dehydration Base, and Radioactive Blue Cheese to collect Cemetery Slats.

You may notice, pillages and misses are relatively frequent here. Don't worry, though, you will end up earning much more gold than other places.

If you start with Sinister Portal, hunt until you can afford the Bottomless Grave trap from the Laboratory Trapsmith.

### The Cycle
- Continue hunting until you have at least 30 Cemetery Slats and the Bottomless Grave trap.

- Use 30 Cemetery Slats to build a barricade with maximum health of 30 HP. Extra Cemetery Slats can be used to repair the barricade any time.

- While the barricade is up, use Bottomless Grave, Dehydration Base and Radioactive Blue Cheese to collect Crimson Curds.

- Once you have obtained 6 Crimson Curds, craft Crimson Cheese with the 3-piece recipe. The 6-piece recipe is not worth the cost.

- Switch to Crimson Cheese to attract Mousevina von Vermin. It is not a guaranteed attraction.

- Loot at least 6 Living Shard from Mousevina von Vermin.

- If you use up all Crimson Cheese without catching Mousevina von Vermin, switch back to Radioactive Blue Cheese to collect more Cemetery Slats and Crimson Curds.

- If you run out of Radioactive Blue Cheese, purchase from Marketplace (if it is lower than 800 gold each). Otherwise, go back to Laboratory to farm Radioactive Blue Cheese Potions.

Repeat the cycle until you catch Mousevina von Vermin.

Claim the adventure **Slay Mousevina von Vermin** after you have caught Mousevina von Vermin.

You may continue this cycle to earn a lot of gold. This will be the best way to earn gold for a while.

Travel to Calm Clearing once you have at least 300,000 gold.

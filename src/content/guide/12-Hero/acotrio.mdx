## Catacombs

![Catacombs](/images/locations/catacombs.png)
<p class="location-description">Deep below the cursed soil of the Mousoleum are underground caverns that stretch to the west where long-forgotten mice roam. These powerful mice are highly resistant to most types of damage and apparently have a weakness for Radioactive Blue cheese. The creatures of the Catacombs seem strangely organized, as if they are preparing for something. Who knows what sinister secrets a hunter may uncover here...?</p>

An Arcane or Forgotten weapon is needed to catch the mice in Catacombs well. Catacombs is quite good for gold farming and is less punishing than Derr Dunes and Mousoleum.

Use your Ancient Box Trap, Aqua Base and Radioactive Blue Cheese here. Collect the following ingredients:

- 12 Scrap Metal from Scavenger Mouse, Terror Knight Mouse or Steel Mouse in Town of Digby
- 1 Onyx Stone from Master of Dojo in the Pinnacle Chamber
- 3 Magic Essences (Smashing SUPERBrie+)
- 1 Obelisk Part (Buy and Smash Obelisk of Slumber from the Trapsmith)

<Callout type="info" title="How to access Town of Digby">
- Loot Living Shards from Mousevina von Vermin in Mousoleum. You may have alread gotten them from your first visit to Mousoleum.
- Craft 3 Limelight Cheese.
- Hunt the Mutated Mole Mice in Laboratory.
- Loot the **Key to the Town of Digby** map piece from the Mutated Mole Mice.
</Callout>

Buy the Arcane Capturing Rod Of Never Yielding Mystery Trap (ACRONYM) for 632,700 gold from the Trapsmith.

Now use ACRONYM with Radioactive Blue Cheese to loot the Keeper's Candle and farm Ancient Potions. There are 2 ways of obtaining Ancient Cheese:

- Craft Ancient Cheese: 6 Ionized Salt + 3 Stale Cheese (6 Piece Recipe is not worth it)
- Brewing Ancient Potion with Gouda Cheese

If you need more Stale Cheese, you have three options:

- Hunt in Forbidden Grove (open) with Radioactive Blue Cheese to loot Stale Cheese This is slower for getting Stale Cheese but at least you are earning gold.
- Buy 1 Tarnished Charm from Marketplace if you donâ€™t have one. Hunt in Catacombs with your stalest set-up, Tarnished Charm and Cheddar Cheese. You only need 1 Tarnished Charm since it is not consumed upon Fail to Attract. This is noticeably faster.
- You can receive Stale Cheese as Gifts from friends, you can find friends over in Discord. Do note that hunters tend to prefer receiving Gifts of the Day, which are often of higher value than Stale Cheese.

Travel to the Forbidden Grove after you have ACRONYM and at least 100 Ancient Cheese.

## Forbidden Grove

![Forbidden Grove](/images/locations/forbidden-grove.png)
<p class="location-description">At the end of the Catacombs, beyond heavy stone gates, lies a hidden hunting ground. Etched into the gates is a warning: 'Beware young soul, should the stone gates close while within this grove, you will find yourself caught between realms.'</p>

Use Arcane Capturing Rod of Never Yielding Mystery, Aqua Base and Ancient Cheese to loot Rune.

Obtain at least 30 Runic Cheese

- Craft Runic Cheese with the 1-piece recipe. This requires Rune. The 2-piece recipe is worth its cost if you can afford it.
- Brew Runic Potion looted in Jungle of Dread.

Keep note of Forbidden Grove's opening and closing timing via [MouseHunt Timers](https://sites.google.com/site/mhtimerslinks/) or #timers in Discord. Every 20 hours, Forbidden Grove is open for 16 hours and closed for 4 hours. You can travel to Forbidden Grove only when it is open. Head out of the area over to Catacombs, continuing the Ancient Cheese farming if needed, every time the Grove is closing and you do not have enough Runic Cheese yet.

Once you have enough Runic Cheese, you will want to wait for Realm Ripper Mouse. Travel to the Grove when it is open, wait till the Grove is closed then use Radioactive Blue cheese to capture the Realm Ripper Mouse, teleporting you directly over to the Acolyte Realm.

## Acolyte Realm

![Acolyte Realm](/images/locations/acolyte-realm.png)
<p class="location-description">Years ago in Bristle Woods, a MouseHunter by the name of Plankrun opened a passageway to another realm. The passage was intended to act as an elaborate one-way trap for Acolyte mice. However, recently, the Acolyte mice have had success in reversing the portal's direction and are attempting to re-enter the Gnawnia Kingdom.</p>

Use Ancient Box Trap, Aqua Base and Runic Cheese. Get some Charms to help increase your Catch Rate, Chrome Charms and the various Snowball Charms (Super and above) are advised due to their cheaper price. Pray for an easy time with Acolyte mouse.

After catching the Acolyte mouse, firstly claim the adventure Capture the Acolyte Mouse then open the Mysterious Box he drops to obtain a Frozen Scroll.

If you still could not rank up to Knight, consider farming gold in the following locations:

- Derr Dunes with Brie/Crunchy Cheese
- Elub Shore with Brie/Seashell Cheese
- Mouseleum with Radioactive Blue Cheese
- Catacombs with Radioactive Blue Cheese

## What to do next

Head over to Dracano when you rank up to Knight.

## Jungle of Dread

![Jungle of Dread](/images/locations/jungle-of-dread.png)
<p class="location-description">Named by the tribes, this dangerous jungle is home to some of the most terrifying mice ever discovered. Long ago the leaders of the tribes discovered a spicy cheese made with peppers capable of distracting the mighty beasts of the jungle. This peppered bait may be the key to luring these mice to a trap...</p>

First of all, the Jungle is a Shadow area once more. You may recall how you‘ve been hunting Shadow mice with an Arcane weapon, because your Shadow trap was not up to the task. 

<Callout type="warning">Bad news: the mice of the Jungle don‘t have an Arcane weakness. It is absolutely vital that you go after them with a Shadow trap.</Callout>

There are some for sale in the store in the Tribal Isles. Which one you go for depends on your funds. Seeing as you don‘t need to be in the Jungle for longer than necessary in the beginning, you can try it out with Bottomless Grave if you don’t have anything better. You should also consider buying some Dreaded Charm from Marketplace. They tend to be fairly inexpensive and offers 300% Power Bonus against Jungle of Dread mice.

Once you’ve decided on a trap, the question is how to proceed for bait. When you go into the Jungle armed with Gouda or Brie you will only attract Swarms of Pygmy Mice and, once in a while, a Pygmy Wrangler Mouse if you‘re lucky. Both mice drop Vanilla Beans, but those are not a priority right now. You want to go after the terrifying Jungle Mice. There are 6 of those and you will need to catch at least one of each.

There are 6 types of Havarti Cheese are required to attract the 6 mice in Jungle of Dread with special loot. Each type of Havarti Cheese corresponds to one of 6 types of Pepper Plants. Pepper Plant is crafted with 2 Pepper Seed and 1 Plant Pot from Cape Clawed General Store. The colour of Pepper Seed determines the type of Pepper Plants obtained. It is advised to craft 3 of each type of Pepper Plants.

| Pepper Seeds                              | Pepper Plant                |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 2 Red Pepper Seeds                        | Spicy Red Pepper Plant      |
| 2 Blue Pepper Seeds                       | Magical Blue Pepper Plant   |
| 2 Yellow Pepper Seeds                     | Sweet Yellow Pepper Plant   |
| 1 Red Pepper Seed & 1 Yellow Pepper Seed  | Creamy Orange Pepper Plant  |
| 1 Red Pepper Seed & 1 Blue Pepper Seed    | Pungent Purple Pepper Plant |
| 1 Blue Pepper Seed & 1 Yellow Pepper Seed | Crunchy Green Pepper Plant  |

Pick pepper from Pepper Plants to get at least 12 Pepper of each type. On average each Pepper Plant gives slightly fewer than 4 pepper. Craft more Pepper Plants if you don’t get enough Pepper. Pepper Plant recipes and type of Pepper picked are summarised in the picture above.

Craft 2 batches of each of the 6 types of Havarti Cheese. Use your best Shadow weapon, Aqua Base, Dreaded Charm and Havarti Cheese. Each Havarti Cheese only attracts 1 mouse. They drop Fire Salt, Runic Potion and one type of trap loot respectively.

The list below shows you the crafting recipe for each cheese. Each cheese must be crafted with 18 Curds & Whey and 6 Salt.

- Spicy Havarti Cheese - 6 Spicy Red Pepper + 12 Coconut Milk

- Magical Havarti Cheese - 6 Spicy Red Pepper + 2 Coconut Milk
- Creamy Havarti Cheese - 6 Spicy Red Pepper + 10 Coconut Milk

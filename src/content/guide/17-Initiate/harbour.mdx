## Harbour

![Harbour](/images/locations/harbour.png)
<p class="location-description">Full of fresh air and plenty of sunshine, the Harbour seems to attract the types of mice who boast of sea salt in their veins.</p>

<Callout>
Harbour is the first area that mice can _steal_ your gold, points or extra cheese. This also happens in the majority of other areas, but don't worry - this only happens when you fail to catch a mouse. If you catch a mouse, you will not lose any gold, points or extra cheese.
</Callout>

- Use Brie Cheese.
- Catch a Pirate Mouse.
- **Begin Search** and catch all crew members on the bounty.
- **Claim Booty** to obtain rewards and A Map Scrap.

Repeat this cycle until all 5 Map Scraps are recovered.

- **Assemble Map** to obtain Calm Clearing Map Piece.
- Claim the adventure **Discover the Harbourâ€™s Secrets**.

Continue the cycle for more bounty until you rank up to Journeyman / Journeywoman.

<li>If you have around 200,000 gold, you can consider buying the **NVMRC Forcefield Trap** instead.</li>

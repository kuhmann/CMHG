## Meadow

![Meadow](/images/locations/meadow.png)
<p class="location-description">Slightly secluded from the human population, the Meadow is mostly inhabited by the more timid breeds of mice. Considered somewhat of a safe haven for novice mouse hunters who hate to see their cheese stolen.</p>

Congratulations MouseHunter! You're on the start of a wonderful adventure.

You start the game as a Novice with 1,000 [gold](/gold-farming) and 3 Cheddar Cheese, which will be plenty to make it through the tutorial.

<Callout>
If you are given a choice between Mouse Hot Tub and High Tension Spring, choose Mouse Hot Tub. Otherwise, you will be given High Tension Spring.

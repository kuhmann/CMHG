Buy Aqua Base. Its 8 luck makes it superior to Dehydration Base and Fan Base.

A Hydro weapon works best against mice in S.S. Huntington IV. However, Ambush Trap, Aqua Base and Brie Cheese would suffice. If you are buying a Hydro weapon, Net Cannon would be the better choice compared to Harpoon Gun.
